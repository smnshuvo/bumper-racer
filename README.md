# Bumper Racer
My first game development, without prior knowledge to game development and C#

## Intro
This took me 4 hours to develop this simple app, I haven't been in game development before, not familiar with *unity* as well. Java helped to me understand C# and it took a while for me to get the concepts of unity physics, collision etc.
However as a first game I don't judge this project.

## Credits
When I was a kid there was a game named F1 Race in my dad's phone (Sprint 7700). I searched a while to in the Google to get an image, but didn't get it. That was the basic idea of developing the game.
